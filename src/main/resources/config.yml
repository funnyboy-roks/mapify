# If the following whitelist should be treated as a blacklist
whitelist-is-blacklist: false

# List of domains that are allowed for users to use.  Be VERY careful with what you allow with this, if users have full access, they can do malicious things.
# This list also supports regular expressions if the entry starts with "REGEXP:", like this: REGEXP:.*\.google\.com, which allows any subdomain of google.com
# Note: this filter only applies when the command is run, not when actually downloading the images on startup or world load.
whitelist:
  - i.imgur.com

# This makes it such that ALL provided urls must use https -- this isn't a perfect safeguard, as someone can proxy through an https server.
# Note: this filter only applies when the command is run, not when actually downloading the images on startup or world load.
https-only: true

# The minutes that the plugin will cache the images
# This should really not be changed unless you know what you are doing.
cache-duration: 60

# Whether the plugin should download the images to the disk
# Note: The images are saved in the `img/` folder with funky names.
#       Do not change the names or the file info as that would mess up the storage method.
save-images: false

# If debug messages should be printed.
debug-logging: false

# Cooldown for the `/mapify` command, in seconds.
cooldown: 0

# Cooldown for operators using the `/mapify` command, in seconds.
op-cooldown: 0

# Maximum size of maps that may be generated.  This can be specified in two ways:
# - Area: If max-size is specified as a single number, it will restrict map creation size by area.
#     i.e., if `max-size: 9`, then a map of size 3x4 is not valid.
# - Bounds: If max-size is specifi as dimensions (WIDTHxHEIGHT), then it will be treated as upper bounds on the width and height
#     i.e., if `max-size: 3x3`, then a map of size 3x4 is not valid.
max-size: -1
